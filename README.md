Translations of "[Text] Soon I will be gone forever, but that's okay as long as someone reads this" from Reddit to different languages.

I was deeply touched by a post on Reddit from a 24 year old, who has chosen his last tie. The author wants to give meaning to his life by sharing with people what he has realized. I want to help him fullfil his wish by translating the post to Korean and share it with people who can't read English. I ask you, internet, to help and translate it to as masy languages as possible.
